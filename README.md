# Dungeon Escape
This is a fun little platformer game, created using C# in the Unity game engine.

## Learning
This game was created as part of the "Complete C# Unity Developer 2D: Learn to Code Making Games" Udemy course. Learning through programming through game development was recommended to me as an approachable and fun way of learning to code. This was my introduction to C# development, object-oriented programming, as well as to game design and game development. This is the final project from this course.

## Alterations
I have made a number of alterations to the game, including using alternate sprites (including character, enemy and background sprites) and different interactable objects.
